CONDITIONAL_PATTERN = r"<!--if\s+([A-Za-z0-9_]+)\s*(<|<=|==|>=|>)\s*([^-^:]+)\s*(:(.*)-->|-->(.*)<!--endif-->)"
"""
This is a pattern that matches content that is shown only if a certain condition
is met.

The regex matches two types of syntax at the same time:
* There is a syntax that is completely enclosed in one HTML comment. The content
then does not get shown in Github. The syntax has the form:
`<!--if variable < value :conditional text-->`
Note that the conditional text includes all whitespace around it, so if the
conditional text should not get spaces around it there should be no whitespace
between the : and the text or between the --> and the text.
* There is also a syntax that leaves the content exposed outside of the HTML
comment. This content then also gets shown in Github. The syntax has the form:
`<!--if variable == value -->conditional text<!--endif-->
Again, the conditional text includes all whitespace between the two HTML
comments.

Note that there may be no whitespace before the "if" keyword or around the
"endif" keyword. This is to reduce false positives.

The pattern matches on six groups:
# The "variable" which is checked against.
# The comparator to compare the variable to the value with. This is one of the
following: < <= == >= >
# The "value" to which to compare the variable.
# This group is used for prioritising the order of operations in the regex
itself and shouldn't be used.
# The conditional text to show when using the "hidden" syntax (the first one as
documented above).
# The conditional text to show when using the "exposed" syntax (the second one
as documented above).

class QtMarkdownRenderer(mistune.Renderer):
	"""
	Specialises the Mistune renderer in order to be better compatible with Qt's
	rich text while degrading gracefully with Github's renderer.

	Mistune converts Markdown into HTML. However its choice for the HTML
	elements to use is not always supported by the limited HTML subset that Qt
	can display with its "rich text" rendering. This class makes sure that the
	supported subset of HTML is used.

	This renderer makes sure that the Markdown that gets interpreted by the
	renderer displays correctly on a conventional Markdown parser such as that
	of Github.

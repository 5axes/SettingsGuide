2.0.1 - Bug fixes
----
* Fix packaging script.
* Fix loading the settings list in Cura 4.3 and newer.

2.0.0 - For Mark(down)
====
In this release all setting articles were completely rewritten, and most images re-made in higher resolution.

New Features
----
* Articles are now stored in Markdown format, allowing greater flexibility in their layout and structure.
* Support for Cura version 4.2.
* Articles can now link to each other.
* Articles can now link to the internet.
* Each image can now have its own subtext.
* Articles can now be added about other things than settings.

Bug fixes
----
* The plug-in will not load all articles any more during the loading screen, which would slow down Cura's boot sequence.

Articles
----
* All articles are rewritten. They now contain much more information on their behaviour and how you'd use them. On average the articles have about 2.5 times as much information.
* Almost all images have been re-made in a higher resolution, with better compression techniques to limit installation size.

* An about category is added with information about the plug-in itself.
* Many corrections have been made to various articles.

1.3.0 - Hillity Usability
====
This release adds many tiny quality-of-life features and improves the quality of images while further reducing download size.

New Features
----
* Improved performance of switching selected settings.
* The dialogue can now be resized. Implements [#2](https://github.com/Ghostkeeper/SettingsGuide/issues/2). The dialogue can also be maximised and minimised.
* The dialogue is no longer modal, allowing you to use Cura while the dialogue is open.
* The image thumbnails grid has been reworked. It uses more of the page width if available and should be more reliable.
* The zoomed image is now always 2/3rds of the window size regardless of window size and screen resolution. Fixes [#5](https://github.com/Ghostkeeper/SettingsGuide/issues/5).
* All image thumbnails and zoomed images now have a white background, in order to improve usability in dark themes. Implements [#4](https://github.com/Ghostkeeper/SettingsGuide/issues/4).
* Quality of image downscaling is improved, producing softer borders and fewer Moir√© patterns.
* All layer view screenshots have their colour depth slightly reduced. The difference is imperceptible, but the file size of the download is reduced significantly.
* Improved installation instructions in the Readme.
* Removed slight transparency of zoomed images.
* Removed slight transparency of the logo.

Bug Fixes
----
* The categories are now properly hidden if necessary while searching for settings.
* Fixed a typo in the entry in the Extensions menu of Cura.
* The dialogue now scales properly on high DPI screens such as Apple's Retina displays.
* The theme of the Settings Guide should match the active theme of Cura itself more closely, if it changes any sizes or colours.

* Connect Top/Bottom Polygons: Added description and preview image.
* Minimum Wall Flow: Added description and preview image.

* CMake support allows developers to install their work to their local Cura installation more easily.

* Images are no longer reduced in quality in order to reduce file size of the plug-in download.

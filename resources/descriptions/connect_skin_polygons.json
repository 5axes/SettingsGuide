		"img_description": "The first image shows a naive concentric pattern. The second shows that all contours get connected together to form one curve.",
		"hints": "This prevents travel moves for the most part. However it creates new sharp corners where the nozzle will have to accelerate and decelerate a lot, which will offset against the win in printing time. The squiggly pattern will also be visible on the outside, which gives an interesting visual effect.",

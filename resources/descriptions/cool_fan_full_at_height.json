		"hints" : "- Itâ€™s also possible to change this parameter by adjusting the layer number at which the fans should be on full speed. \n- Using a higher value increases the adhesion to the bed, but can also lead to oozing and a reduced print quality. Printing with the fans on full from a height of 0.5 mm is usually sufficient."

		"description": "Retraction is used at the places in a print where the printer has to do a travel move between two printed parts. Without retraction, extruded material will hang between the parts. ",
		"img_description" : "The left image has retractions disabled (blue travel moves), the right image has retractions enabled (purple travel moves).",
		"hints" : "- By using retraction, “stringing” (thin threads of plastic in between the printed parts) is prevented, resulting in a much cleaner model.\n- Exercise caution when using flexible materials or models that require a lot of retractions as it may lead to grinding of the filament."

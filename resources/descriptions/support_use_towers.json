		"hints": "For stability, support towers have a larger diameter than the region they support. If necessary, the tower diameter can be changed to create either a bigger or smaller support tower. The towerâ€™s diameter decreases near the overhang, forming a roof. By adjusting the tower roof angle you can define how pointy or flat the tower roof should be.",

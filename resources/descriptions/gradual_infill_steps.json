		"description" : "Gradual infill reduces the amount of infill used by decreasing the infill percentage in the lower layers. Every gradual infill step divides the infill percentage by a factor two. The result is a dense infill near the top layers, which is essential, and a reduced print time.",	
		"img_description" : "The image on the left is printed with normal infill, the image on the right has two gradual infill steps.",
		"hints" : "- Example: Starting with an infill percentage of 20% and two gradual infill steps, reduces the infill to 10% and 5% respectively.",
		"notes" : "Note: The infill density divides by two for every gradual infill step used. Be careful not to reduce the infill too much."

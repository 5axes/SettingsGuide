This setting causes the build plate to be heated to a different temperature while the first layer is being printed.

The build plate allows the material to cool down faster because the heat from the molten material can transfer faster to the build plate than to the insulating air. Having the build plate heated slightly hotter while the first layer is being printed keeps the material away from the freezing point a bit longer, so that it doesn't get a temperature shock which causes the layer to shrink and warp.

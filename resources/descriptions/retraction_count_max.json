		"img_description": "This image illustrates a cross section of the feeder, with the 'maximum retraction count' indicated.",
		"hints": "- The benefit of maximizing the amount of retractions is that it decreases the possibility of grinding.\n- However, for models with a lot of holes (e.g. a voronoi print), this can lead to stringing if the value is too low."

This setting specifies how thick the horizontal parts of your mould will become. These horizontal parts will be placed on top of the mould, and beneath it.

There will not be a horizontal part at the highest point of your model, so that you can pour the material in. There will also not be a horizontal part beneath the model, because the build plate itself serves to close the mould there. If a horizontal part beneath the model is desired, the raft can be used to that end.

With a thinner layer height you can increase the quality of the print, leading to a smoother surface and more detail visible in the Z-direction (height) of the model. On the other hand, by using thicker layers you can decrease the print time substantially.",

The number of available layer heights options differ per configuration. The custom mode allows the user to completely customize the layer height. \n- In the custom mode, choose a layer height close to your desired custom layer height. The profile contains layer height dependent settings, like temperatures, to ensure a high-quality print.",

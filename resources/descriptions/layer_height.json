		"description": "The 3D printer puts down plastic in layers. The layer height is the thickness of these layers in millimeters. It is the most important factor in both the visual quality of your final print and the printing time.",
		"img_description": "The model on the left has a smaller layer height than the model on the right.",
		"hints": "- Having thinner layers will increase the visual quality of the print, because the surface will be smoother and more detail will be visible in the Z-direction (height) of the print.\n- Using thicker layers will reduce the print time substantially.\n- Many settings depend on the layer height. Because layer height significantly affects the flow rate of material through the nozzle, many parameters of the printing process will change. This is very complex. For instance, when increasing the layer height, you should probably increase the printing temperature slightly to offset the extra rate of heat loss. It is always wise to start from the pre-made quality profile available to your printer that has a layer height close to what you want.\n- At very low layer heights, you could run into the resolution limit of your Z axis. Look up the step size of your printer's Z axis and make sure that the layer height is a multiple of this. Otherwise you could run into banding.",
		"notes": "Note: You can choose a desired layer height in Custom Mode, but pre-made profiles are available with various layer heights as well. You can choose from profiles for various layer heights in the Recommended Mode using a slider or using the drop-down widget in Custom Mode. Since these profiles also change some parameters that depend on the layer height, you'll probably achieve a better quality that way."

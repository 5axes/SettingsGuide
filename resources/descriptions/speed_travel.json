		"description": "This is the speed at which the print head moves when itâ€™s not extruding. A higher travel speed decreases the chance of filament oozing from the nozzle, resulting in a cleaner object. However, higher speed could also cause the nozzle to hit a previously printed part, which may damage the print due to the heated nozzle. This can be prevented by using Z-hop when retracting.",

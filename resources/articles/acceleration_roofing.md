This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the top surface. The acceleration during the top surface can be set to a different rate than the rest of the skin.

Reducing the acceleration during the top surface can achieve better water tightness while not incurring as large a penalty on printing time as when the entire top side is adjusted.

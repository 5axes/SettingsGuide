This setting determines which parts of the model get supported with a specialised support tower and which get supported with ordinary support. Any pieces of support that have a smaller diameter than specified in this setting will get supported by a support tower. Any pieces that are wider will get supported with normal support.

The larger this setting, the more towers will get generated. This makes the support more stable but also increases the time and material usage of support.

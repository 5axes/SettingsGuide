Has Build Volume Temperature Stabilization
====
This setting describes whether or not the printer has control over the temperature of its build volume. 

All 3D printers warm up their build volume to some extent, by the heaters in their nozzles and build plates, but some printers have active heating or ventilation systems and a temperature probe. This allows them to control the temperature inside its build volume.

If this setting is disabled, the [Build Volume Temperature](../material/build_volume_temperature.md) setting is hidden from the interface. 

*Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible to the user.*

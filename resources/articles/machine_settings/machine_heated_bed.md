Has Heated Build Plate
====
This setting indicates whether or not the printer has a build plate that can control the temperature. These types of build plates are installed in many 3D printers to improve adhesion between the print and the build plate.

If the printer has no heated build plate, the [Build Plate Temperature](../material/material_bed_temperature.md) setting and its related settings will not be shown to the user. Cura will also not issue any build plate temperature commands to the printer.

*Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible to the user.*

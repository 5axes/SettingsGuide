The maximum deviation from the base layer height (from the selected profile) in either direction.
For example if the base layer height is 150 microns, and the variation is set to 100, the adaptive layers algorithm will calculate a layer height between 50 and 250 microns.
Note that choosing a deviation that is too large, the print quality could suffer because the lower boundary exceeds the smallest layer height your 3D printer can physically print at.

Pillowing is an effect where small bulges or holes appear in between the infill lines on the top side of the model. It is most often seen on (otherwise) flat top surfaces when printing at high flow rates.

Pillowing is a combination of several effects which work together to cause a bulging effect on the top side of the print.

The recognisable bulging of the top skin is actually a form of [warping](warping.md) where the top skin is compressed by the surrounding walls and underlying infill. Since the walls and infill are printed first in the lower layers, they will cool down and shrink while the skin is still being printed. While shrinking, the walls and infill push the skin lines inside to the point where they are bulging.

Another major factor in pillowing is the sagging of the skin lines in between the infill lines. Depending on the distance between the infill lines, the skin lines need to bridge quite a distance. If cooling is insufficient, the plastic will sag a bit. This makes the skin lines adhere less well to each other, leaving gaps between them. It takes a few layers of skin to repair that.

The pillowing effect tends to bulge up rather than down. While both up and down can happen, bulging up is more common since the nozzle is pulling on the top side of the plastic as it traverses over the skin, which exerts a shearing force upwards for a short moment. Once the lines are bulging upwards, the warping effect keeps them upwards.

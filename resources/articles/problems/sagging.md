Fused Filament Fabrication works through laying down a line of molten plastic. This line is soft, and if it doesn't rest on anything it will droop down. This is called sagging.

Sagging tends to make overhanging parts look stringy. Rather than smoothly following the intended surface of the model, it will be too low. In extreme cases, the bottom side of a surface becomes so ragged that the hollow inside of the print can be seen.

Causes
----
Sagging is actually not, or hardly, caused by gravity. It is mostly caused by the force of the material being pushed out the nozzle. As such, even printers that are turned upside down or printing in microgravity will experience this phenomenon. The pressure by which the material is extruded pushes the material down because the nozzle is (normally) oriented downwards.

Normally the pressure inside the nozzle chamber is necessary to push the (viscous) material outside and flatten it in the shape of a wide and flat line of material, by squishing it between the nozzle and the previous layer or the build plate. However if there was no material in the previous layer there will be no counter-pressure to flatten the bead. Instead it will be pushed too far down.

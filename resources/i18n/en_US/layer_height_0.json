    "hints" : "- When the model has a lot of detail on the first layer, it might have a decreased quality because of the thicker layer. This limitation can be compensated for with the 'initial layer horizontal expansion' setting, which is found under the Shell category.\n- The initial layer line width and print speed also affect the adhesion to the build plate.",

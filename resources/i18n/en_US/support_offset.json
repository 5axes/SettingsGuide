		"description" : "By using horizontal expansion, an offset can be applied to support structures in the X and Y direction. High values will expand the support areas, resulting in sturdier support. Very thin support areas can be removed completely by using a negative value. The right side support of the model below can easily be printed, although the supported area is very thin.",

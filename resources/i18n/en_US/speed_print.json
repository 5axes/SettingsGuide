    "description" : "The print speed defines the speed (in mm/s) at which the print head moves while printing. Based on this setting, Ultimaker Cura calculates the extrusion flow.",
    "img_description" : "This image shows the visualization of the different print speeds per model feature.",
    "hints" : "- A higher print speed will lead to a shorter print time. Keep in mind that increasing the print speed means that you may have to increase the temperature as well to ensure the filament is properly melted.\n- Although you can choose one overall print speed for the complete print, it is also possible to use different print speeds for specific parts of the print."

		"description" : "This setting adjusts the thickness of walls of the model. Ultimaker Cura rounds the wall thickness to a multiplication of the line width. In general, a wall thickness of two or three times the line width is sufficient. A higher value will create a sturdier model and decreases the chance of leaks, while a lower value can significantly decrease the print time and filament costs.",

		"notes" : "Note: Printing with a single wall greatly increases the chance of infill showing through the wall, decreasing model quality."

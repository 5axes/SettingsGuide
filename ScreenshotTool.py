This module provides an automatic way to generate screenshots for the Settings Guide.

The goals of this tool are:
* To have a canonical way to create screenshots, ensuring that the look and feel is consistent.
* To be able to re-create screenshots automatically, if Cura changes something in the way that their scene looks.
* To ensure that screenshots are compressed properly.
* To allow external contributors to define screenshots through code.

The process of creating these screenshots is very complex! It involves several stages and has a bunch of
dependencies. The dependencies that need to be installed to create the screenshots are:
* Linux: The tool is only designed to work on Linux at the moment.
* OpenSCAD: After downloading the 3D model files, they are compiled with OpenSCAD to STL files that Cura can read.
* ImageMagick: Used to reduce colour depth and to combine screenshots into GIF animations.
* OptiPNG: To pre-process for optimising PNG files.
* Efficient-Compression-Tool: To refine optimisation of PNG files.
* Gifsicle: To optimise GIF files.

These dependencies can be installed on Ubuntu by running:
`sudo apt install openscad gimp optipng gifsicle`
Only Efficient-Compression-Tool has to be compiled separately from source. Make sure it ends up in the path. It can
be found here: https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool

The tool is available by setting the preference "settings_guide/screenshot_tool" to True. A button will then be
visible on every article. When pressed, it will re-create the images for that article. A button will also be present
on the landing page that will re-create ALL images. This takes a long time!
